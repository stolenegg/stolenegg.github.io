	<h3>About us:</h3>

  <p>
		The <strong>stolenegg</strong> philosophy is the marriage of technical expertise and creative flair. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Ask most 'web designers' about SEO or content accessibility and you'll most likely be met with a blank stare.
		Similarly, most programmers couldn't tell you the first thing about layout, typography or colour theory.
	</p>
	
	<p> 
		Whilst our background is in commercial software engineering and database development, our passion is for good design, which means you get the best of both worlds, whatever your project involves.
