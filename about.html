  <h3>About us:</h3>

  <p>
    The <strong>stolenegg</strong> philosophy is the marriage of technical expertise and creative flair.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ask most 'web designers' about SEO or content accessibility and you'll most likely be met with a blank stare.
    Similarly, most programmers couldn't tell you the first thing about layout, typography or colour theory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whilst our background is in commercial software engineering and database development, our passion is for good design, which means you get the best of both worlds, whatever your project involves.

  <p>
    Why '<strong>stolenegg</strong>'? We get asked that a lot.</p>

  <p>No, it's not intended to be some trendy, off-the-wall <em>Web 2.0</em> name, it's just an anagram of... well, we'll let you work that bit out.
